# py4DSTEM sample code and tutorials

This directory contain sample code intended to provide an introduction to the py4DSTEM package and various examples of its use.

The sample code here is under development.  The notebooks currently working with py4DSTEM v12.0+ are:
- `quickstart.ipynb`
- `visualize/show.ipynb`
- `visualize/show_image_grids.ipynb`
- `visualize/show_calibrated_data.ipynb`
- `strainmap_crystalline/calibrate.ipynb`
- `strainmap_crystalline/strainmap.ipynb`

If you're new to the package, try beginning with `quickstart.ipynb` :D
